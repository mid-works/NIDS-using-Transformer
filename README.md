## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transformer-nids.git
cd transformer-nids
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

1. **Packet Capture Layer**: Scapy-based real-time packet sniffer
2. **Flow Analysis**: Feature extraction and flow timeout handling
3. **Preprocessing**: Feature scaling and categorical encoding
4. **Detection Engine**: Transformer model for classification
5. **Alert System**: Multi-threshold alert generation
6. **GUI**: Real-time monitoring dashboard

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Administrative privileges for packet capture
- NVIDIA GPU (recommended for training)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/mid-works/NIDS-using-Transformer
cd NIDS-using-Transformer

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage üöÄ

### Data Preparation
Place your dataset in `data/` directory:
- `UNSW_NB15_training-set.csv` - Network flow data with labels

### Training the Model
```bash
# Train with default settings
python main.py --retrain

# Use pre-trained model (default)
python main.py
```

### Real-Time Monitoring
1. Select network interface from GUI dropdown
2. Click "Start Monitoring"
3. View real-time statistics and alerts

## Dataset üìä

The system uses the [UNSW-NB15 dataset](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset) by default. To use custom data:

Required columns in CSV:
```csv
dur,proto,service,state,spkts,dpkts,sbytes,dbytes,rate,sload,dload,label
```

## Training Models üß†

Configuration options in `CONFIG` dictionary:
- Model hyperparameters
- Flow timeout settings
- Alert thresholds
- Feature selection count

Example training output:
```
